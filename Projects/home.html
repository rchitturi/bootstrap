					<img src="images/smilingPig.jpg" alt="smilingPig" align="right" class="img-responsive" />
					<p>Smiling Pig and DucksWe are a 501(c)3 non-profit farm animal sanctuary nestled in the North Hills of Pittsburgh, PA. Our mission 
					is to rescue neglected pigs, goats, sheep, and poultry, llama, and alpaca. These animals have been surrendered at local animal 
					shelters, confiscated by local humane agents, or saved from factory farms. They now live out their lives with comfortable housing,
					nutritious food, and companionship from others of their own kind. They also receive endless love and affection from the human 
					components of the sanctuary!</p>

					<p>Hope Haven is also a resource to raise public awareness about the plight of animals raised for food and promote a cruelty-free,
					plant-based lifestyle. Rather than focusing on the horrors and cruelty inherent in factory farming we want to showcase the 
					individuality and personality of farm animals. Our hope is that when people realize these animals are sentient beings deserving 
					of compassion they will make up their own minds to respect life and adopt a cruelty-free lifestyle.</p>

					<p>Look around the site and learn more! Check out the pictures of our wonderful animals! If you like 
					what you see please donate to help these ambassadors for farm animals everywhere. We appreciate everything you do to help animals,
					spread compassion, and make this a more joyful world to live in.
					<br/>Thank you!</p>
					</p>
					<p>
