					<img src="images/meandoliver.jpg" alt="meandoliver" align="right" style="height:280px;" class="img-responsive" />
					The idea of Hope Haven was born in 2008 while I was driving to Pittsburgh from my hometown in 
					Vermont. I was thinking about my career as a spay/neuter veterinary surgeon and how I loved working to stop the pet

					overpopulation problem. But recently I had been becoming upset by the number of unwanted ducks, pigs, and chickens 
					being surrendered at the shelter. Farm animals cannot be properly housed at most shelters and I had been taking many 
					of these animals home to care for myself. Rehabilitating a tiny pot-bellied piglet named Isaac had opened my eyes to the 
					exuberant love-of-life farm animals feel. Isaac would romp and jump like a puppy, seek me out for companionship, and give 
					me looks that were so expressive I always knew what he was “saying”. I shuddered at the thought of what would have happened to 
					Isaac if he had gone to auction or to a worse fate. So during that long drive home from New England I asked myself this 
					question, “What would I do with my life if I KNEW I couldn’t fail?” That question opened my eyes to my life’s purpose! I would 
					start a farm animal sanctuary and raise public awareness to the plight of thousand of voiceless animals. </p>

					<p>
					<img src="images/piggy.jpg" alt="piggy" align="right" style="height:220px;" class="img-responsive" />
					After more than 4 long years of searching, the sanctuary property was purchased in June of 2011. 
					It is a diamond-in-the-rough, but the potential will make your heart sing! The land is close enough to the city to invite visitors,
					but also has the perfect mix of pasture land and woods to keep many needy animals happy and safe. The little house has been 
					renovated and currently is the home of the farm's founder. One day, we hope to offer it to a caretaker who will keep a watchful
					eye on the animals. A large outbuilding has been altered into a sturdy and expansive poultry house that even brags solar 
					lighting! A beautiful bank barn welcomes the hoof stock and an expansive shed is the cozy home of the pig herd.
					A man-made pond was created explicitly for the pleasure of ducks and geese. There is a beautiful walking trail on the property,
					as well as environmental updates such as rain water barrels, a veggie garden, a small fruit orchid, and compost units.</p>

					<p>This has all taken SO MUCH work, but the effort has had an unbelievable payoff. 
					The joy and peace this sanctuary brings to visitors and animals is life-changing. It's extremely satisfying to 
					
					know that Pittsburgh benefits from having this source for farm animal welfare information and humane education. 
					The amazing story of Hope Haven is still in its infancy. We need YOUR help! I hope you all will join us on this 
					great adventure.</p>
